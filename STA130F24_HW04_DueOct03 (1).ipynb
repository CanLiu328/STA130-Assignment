    "Definition:\n",
    "Standard Deviation (SD): Measures the spread or variability of individual data points in a dataset. It shows how much the values in the dataset differ from the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "Standard Error of the Mean (SEM): Measures how much the sample mean (the average of a sample) is likely to vary from the true population mean. It reflects the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "Standard Deviation (SD): Describes the variability of data points around the mean. A larger SD indicates greater variability within the dataset.\n",
    "Standard Error of the Mean (SEM): Describes the uncertainty in the estimate of the population mean. A smaller SEM indicates a more precise estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "Standard Deviation (SD): Does not depend on sample size. It is a measure of the variability within the data itself.\n",
    "Standard Error of the Mean (SEM): Depends on sample size. As the sample size increases, SEM decreases, because a larger sample provides a more accurate estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "Standard Deviation (SD): Used to describe the spread of individual data points within a dataset. It’s typically used when summarizing the data.\n",
    "Standard Error of the Mean (SEM): Used to indicate the reliability of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean. It is commonly used in inferential statistics, particularly when reporting the precision of an estimate (e.g., in confidence intervals).\n",
    "$SD = sqrt( (1 / (N - 1)) * sum((xi - mean_x)^2) )$\n",
    "$SEM = SD / sqrt(N)$\n",
    "Idea: SD tells you how much individual data points deviate from the mean. It gives you an idea of the overall distribution of the data and whether the data points are clustered close to the mean or spread out over a wide range.\n",
    "Distinct Concept: It reflects inherent variability within the sample or population. A larger SD means data points are more spread out from the mean, while a smaller SD means data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "Example: In an exam, if most students score close to the average, the SD will be small. If scores are scattered widely, the SD will be large.\n",
    "2. Standard Error of the Mean (SEM): Captures the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "Idea: SEM tells you how much the sample mean (average) would fluctuate if you repeated the sampling process multiple times. It reflects the uncertainty in using the sample mean to estimate the true population mean.\n",
    "Distinct Concept: SEM decreases as the sample size increases, because larger samples provide more reliable estimates of the population mean. The SEM is therefore a measure of estimation accuracy rather than the spread of data.\n",
    "Example: If you survey 10 people about their average income, your sample mean may not be very accurate, and the SEM will be relatively large. If you survey 1,000 people, your estimate of the population mean will be more precise, leading to a smaller SEM.\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "SD: Describes the variation within the data itself (how data points differ from each other).\n",
    "SEM: Describes the variation of the sample mean (how the sample mean might differ from the population mean).\n",
    "While SD focuses on variability among the data points, SEM focuses on how well the sample represents the population mean.\n",

    "### 7. The \"Pre-lecture\" video (above) introduced hypothesis testing by saying that \"the confidence interval covers zero, so we cannot reject the hypothesis that the drug is **[on average]** not doing anything\".  This conclusion could be referred to as \"failing to reject the null hypothesis\", where the term \"null\" refers to the concept of \"no effect **[on average]**\".  Why does a confidence interval overlapping zero \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\" when the observed sample mean statistic itself is not zero? Alternatively, what would lead to the opposite conclusion in this context; namely, instead choosing \"to reject the null hypothesis\"?

Hopefully the meanings and distinctions here are increasingly obvious, as they should be if you have a clear understanding of the answer to question \"5\" above. Related to this, the quotes above have been edited to include \"**[on average]**\" which more accurately clarifies the intended meaning of the statements from the video. It's very relevent (again related to Question \"5\" above) to understand why are we bothering with making an explicit distinction with this, and why is it slightly different to say that \"the drug is on average not doing anything\" as opposed to saying \"the drug is not doing anything\"._\n",
