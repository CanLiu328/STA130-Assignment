    "Feel free to work on the \"Post-lecture\" HW below if you're making good progress and want to continue: for **HW 08** this could be reasonable because, as you'll see, the process of creating and using **classification decision trees** is quite similar to the process for creating and using **multiple linear regression** models. There are differences of course, such as how there is **coefficient hypothesis testing** in **multiple linear regression** and **confusion matrices** in **classification decision trees**, and so on. But you would very likely be able to leverage the silarities to make a lot of progress with **classification decision trees** based on your experience with **multiple linear regression**.\n",

Thus overall \"criterion\" noted above improves with each new **decision node splitting rule**, so the improvement can thus be tracked and the improvement contributions attributed to the **feature** upon which the **decision node splitting rule** is based.  This means the relative contribution of each **predictor variable** to the overall explanatory power of the model can be calculated, and this is what the `.feature_importances_` attribute does. \n",

    "> Compared to the simplicity of understanding how different **covariates** contribute towards the final **predicted values** of **multiple linear regression models** (by just reading off the equation to see how predictions work), the the complexity of how all the different **features** interact and combine to together to create the final **predictions** from **classification decision trees** can be staggering. But the so-called **feature importance** heuristics allows us to judge how relatively important the overall contributions from different features are in the final decision tree predictions. Now we just need to be sure we're not **overfitting** our **classification decision trees** since they can be so **complex**. Fortunately, the \"GridSearchCV\" methodology mentioned in regards to finding the best `max_depth` setting for a tree is going to provide a general answer to the challenge of complexity and **overfitting** in **machine learning models** that is not too hard to understand (and which you might already have some guesses or a hunch about). \n",
